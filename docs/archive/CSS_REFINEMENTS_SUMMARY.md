## Design Principles Applied

✅ **Subtlety**: Reduced blur, opacity, and shadow intensity for refined glassmorphism  
✅ **Consistency**: Unified approach across cards, terminal, and builder components  
✅ **Accessibility**: Maintained WCAG AA contrast ratios, refined dark mode colors  
✅ **Performance**: Reduced shadow complexity and blur effects  
✅ **Responsiveness**: All changes maintain mobile, tablet, and desktop compatibility  
✅ **CSS Variables**: All colors and spacing use project variables (no hardcoded values)
